PROBLEM STATEMENT
•Lack of interactive, real-world learning experiences in digital education.
•Current ed-tech tools do not utilize physical objects for engagement.
•Probability and statistics are abstract concepts, making it difficult for students to
grasp real-world applications.
•Need for adaptive, gamified learning experiences that cater to different skill
levels.
PROPOSED SOLUTION
We propose an AI-powered platform that uses computer vision and machine learning to
recognize playing cards and generate interactive, probability-based learning activities.
Core Features:
Card Recognition with AI – Uses OpenCV + TensorFlow to detect and classify playing
cards via a webcam.
Probability Calculator – Teaches probability theory using real-time card analysis.
Gamified Learning – Challenges, leaderboards, and Kahoot!-style quizzes to make
learning engaging.
Adaptive Learning Paths – AI suggests educational activities based on detected
objects (e.g., probability of drawing a particular card)
INNOVATION AND UNIQUENESS
•First-of-its-kind AI-powered probability learning tool integrating physical
playing cards and real-time simulations.
•Uses augmented reality (AR) and computer vision to turn real-world
materials into educational assets.
•Gamification (XP, rewards, skill challenges) to motivate students.
•Adaptive AI-based content ensures a personalized learning experience.
Tech Stack:
•Computer Vision: OpenCV, TensorFlow (Pre-trained model for card recognition)
•AI Models: OpenAI API for generating adaptive learning experiences
•Frontend: Streamlit (for rapid prototyping), React.js (for web UI)
•Backend: Flask/FastAPI (to process card recognition and probability calculations)
•Database: Firebase (real-time collaboration & storage)
•Gamification: Kahoot!-style quiz system integrated with AI
Technical Feasibility:
•Pre-trained models for playing card recognition exist, reducing development
time.
•Uses existing APIs (OpenCV, TensorFlow, Firebase, OpenAI) to build a scalable
solution.
•The platform can be deployed as a web-based or mobile-friendly application.
Business Viability:
•Can be adopted by schools, online tutoring platforms, and self-learners.
•Subscription-based model for advanced features (e.g., AI tutor, gamified
challenges).
•Open-source community contributions can help expand features and adoption.
Impact:
•Enhances real-world understanding of probability and statistics.
•Encourages hands-on learning using physical materials.
•Boosts student engagement and retention through interactive challenges.
